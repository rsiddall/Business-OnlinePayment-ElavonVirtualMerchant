Business-OnlinePayment-ElavonVirtualMerchant version 0.03
=========================================================

This module provides an interface to the Elavon (formerly Nova Information
Systems) Virtual Merchant real-time payment gateway from applications
using the Business::OnlinePayment API.

INSTALLATION

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Business::OnlinePayment::HTTPS

TESTING

You can test against the Elavon demo server by setting the environment variables:

  ELAVON_SERVER=demo.myvirtualmerchant.com
  ELAVON_PATH=/VirtualMerchantDemo/process.do (The path is not the same as on the live server.)
  ELAVON_ACCOUNT and ELAVON_USERID will be the user ID allocated to you by Elavon's internet support group.
  ELAVON_PASSWORD will be the PIN for that user set when you log into the demo server control panel.
  DEBUG can be set to a variety of values. 0 suppresses most information, while 10 gives you a lot of information about what's being sent and received. This can reveal that you don't have Crypt::SSLeay installed, or your login credentials are wrong.
